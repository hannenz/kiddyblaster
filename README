## Some words on ...

... sound quality: It's not as decent as I wished it would be, don't expect HiFi. The speakers are really not so well. But it's ok for listening to audiobooks and some music

... WiFi?  I decided to not spoil my children's room with WiFi and to keep my box without WiFi, however adding WiFi is easy (search for it in the internets) Thus I decidede to add a RJ52 plug for maintenance.
